/**
 * PRATIKSHYA FASHON — Mega-menu editorial media contracts.
 *
 * The navigation's editorial panel must resolve a department-correct plate
 * from canonical data alone. These tests lock down:
 *
 *   · every department resolves imagery from its OWN canonical scope
 *   · Collections resolves collection/editorial imagery, not a product dump
 *   · nothing is hardcoded — no product ids, no filenames in the component
 *   · DRAFT / SUBMITTED / APPROVED products never reach the menu as products
 *   · clearing LocalStorage and re-reading is stable (a refresh is stable)
 *   · Marketing Media and hero workflows are untouched
