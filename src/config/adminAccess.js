/**
 * PRATIKSHYA FASHON — Admin workspace access model.
 *
 * The Admin Portal is a separate authentication boundary from the customer
 * storefront; the Employee Operations Portal is the staff workspace for
 * SUPER_EMPLOYEE / EMPLOYEE levels. Authorization is capability-based:
 * ADMIN authority is the sum of the capabilities actually held and is always
 * below SUPER_ADMIN (the top-level override).
 *
 * Permission strings on this surface are the canonical capability codes from
 * `config/rbacModel.js` (mirrored and ENFORCED by `app/core/rbac.py`).
 * Legacy granular codes kept in the session permission list satisfy
 * capability checks through the shared expansion, and vice versa, so the two
 * vocabularies stay contract-aligned during (and after) consolidation.
