/**
 * PRATIKSHYA FASHON — Media vocabulary.
 *
 * The single source of truth for every media constant the house uses:
 * what a piece of media *is* (image or video), what it is *for* (a product
 * role or a marketing placement), whether it is *published*, and what a
 * demo upload is allowed to be.
 *
 * Pages, services and forms import from here. No component invents a media
 * type, role, placement or status string of its own.
 *
 * Media itself is stored through `services/media/mediaRepository`. This file
 * carries vocabulary only — no state, no storage, no React.

/**
 * A placement is a real surface of the storefront.
 *
 * `live: true` means the storefront reads this placement today — an ACTIVE
 * record assigned to it replaces the seeded artwork on that surface.
 * `live: false` placements are catalogued sections of the house that do not
 * yet read from the media repository; the Marketing page says so plainly
 * rather than implying an effect that does not exist.
 *
 * Every placement also declares what kind of content it holds:
 *
 *   · PRODUCT placements display pieces from the canonical product catalogue.
 *     They are curated through the Product Catalog Selector, which stores
 *     product IDs only — the catalogue remains the single source of truth for
 *     the product's name, taxonomy and media. `recommendedDepartment` /
 *     `recommendedCategory` / `recommendedSubcategory` describe the taxonomy
 *     the section is built around so the selector can open pre-arranged, but
 *     they never lock the catalogue down. A PRODUCT placement whose documented
 *     surface is a category listing page (`listingSurface: true`) renders its
 *     curated rail on that taxonomy's listing route; the rail matcher reads
 *     exactly these recommended taxonomy fields, never a hardcoded route.
 *     `houseSelectionFallback: true` marks the seams that keep a curated,
 *     data-driven house edit when nothing is assigned — every other product
 *     seam simply stays hidden until the desk curates it (no catalogue
 *     fallback, no random products).
 *
 *   · GENERIC placements display house artwork (hero plates, editorial
 *     storytelling, promotion artwork). They keep the existing media-upload
 *     workflow. The Festive campaign band is a PRODUCT placement: its image
 *     is the published product an admin assigns, exactly like the Saree and
 *     Groom edits.
 *
 * Every placement marked `live: true` is read by a real storefront seam —
 * product placements through the marketing placement register, generic
 * placements through the marketing media register. Nothing is advertised as
 * live that the storefront does not actually consume.
