/**
 * PRATIKSHYA FASHON — Canonical storefront routing (Phase 21.7).
 *
 * Category and collection routes are derived from the managed taxonomy
 * records — never invented in a component. Every homepage, shop and
 * collection card asks here for its destination, so the URL a card points at
 * is always the same slug the taxonomy repository owns.
 *
 * A route is only offered for an ACTIVE record; anything archived, drafted or
 * hidden resolves to `null` and the caller drops the card rather than
 * pointing a customer at a dead or generic destination.
