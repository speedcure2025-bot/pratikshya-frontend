/**
 * PRATIKSHYA FASHON — Mega-menu editorial media resolution.
 *
 * The navigation's editorial panel is a DISTRIBUTION SURFACE, not a data
 * source. It owns no image list, no product list and no filenames: it asks
 * this module for one plate and paints it.
 *
 *   MEGA MENU
 *       ↓  navigation group (women / bridal / men / kids / collections)
 *   DEPARTMENT or COLLECTION CONTEXT      ← derived from canonical taxonomy
 *       ↓
 *   CANONICAL MEDIA RESOLUTION            ← curated placement → product media
 *       ↓                                   → authored catalogue plate
 *   BEST ELIGIBLE IMAGE
 *
 * The scope is DERIVED, never authored: a department group resolves against
 * the canonical department it already routes to, and the Collections group
 * resolves against the very collection its editorial feature already links
 * to. Adding a department to `src/data/catalog/taxonomy.js` therefore gives
 * that department a working editorial panel with no change here.
 *
 * Resolution chain (first rung that yields a plate wins):
 *
 *   1. MARKETING_PLACEMENT       a PRODUCT placement the Marketing desk has
 *                                curated for exactly this department. Only
 *                                PUBLISHED products can resolve, because the
 *                                live storefront list is what is consulted.
 *   2. PUBLISHED_PRODUCT_MEDIA   the department's best PUBLISHED product,
 *                                painted with its own canonical Product Media
 *                                set (product-owned plates only).
 *   3. AUTHORED_CATALOGUE_PLATE  the department's own authored canonical
 *                                catalogue plate — the same STATIC_CATALOG
 *                                rung `resolveCategoryCover` already uses for
 *                                the homepage category cards.
 *   4. COLLECTION_COVER          the Collections group only: the existing
 *                                `resolveCollectionCover` chain (managed
 *                                banner → collection media → member product →
 *                                authored collection plate).
 *   5. null                      nothing eligible — the panel keeps its
 *                                neutral placeholder. An unrelated
 *                                department's imagery is NEVER substituted.
 *
 * Draft safety: rungs 1–2 can only ever surface PUBLISHED products. Rung 3 is
 * artwork, not merchandising — it exposes no product name, no price and no
 * product route, and the panel always links to the department's own listing
 * route. A DRAFT / SUBMITTED / APPROVED product is therefore never presented
 * as a shoppable piece by the navigation.
 *
 * Selection is deterministic and stable: the same catalogue and register
 * always produce the same plate, so a refresh or a cleared LocalStorage never
 * reshuffles the navigation.
 *
 * No React. No storage writes. No filenames. No product ids.
